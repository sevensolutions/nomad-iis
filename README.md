This repository contains a task driver for [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) to run web-applications in IIS on Windows machines. Unlike most other Nomad task drivers, this one is written in the C# language using ASP.NET 8.
It uses the *Microsoft.Web.Administration*-API to communicate with IIS.
Feel free to use it as-is or as a reference implementation for your own C#-based Nomad-plugins.

        cpu    = 100
        memory = 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🌎 Environment Variables

All System Environment Variables available to the Nomad Client will be applied to the Application Pool.
You can supply additional ones by using the [`env` Block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification/env) in the `task` stanza.

## ✨ Supported Signals

The Nomad IIS driver supports the following signals:

| Signal | Description |
|---|---|
| `SIGHUP` or `RECYCLE` | Recycles the Application Pool |
| `SIGINT` or `SIGKILL` | Stops and removes the Application. Note: When sending this signal manually, the job gets re-scheduled. |

To send a *RECYCLE* signal, run:

```
nomad alloc signal -s RECYCLE <allocation> <task>
```

Details about the command can be found [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/commands/alloc/signal).

## 🛡 Filesystem Isolation

Because there is no `chroot` on Windows, filesystem isolation is only handled via permissions.
For every AppPool, IIS creates a dedicated AppPool Service Account which is only allowed to access it's own directories. See commits of [GH-5](https://github.com/sevensolutions/nomad-iis/issues/5) for details.

Given a job spec with two tasks, the following table depicts the permissions for each AppPool *task1* and *task2* inside the [allocation directory](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/concepts/filesystem).

| Directory | Access Level |
|---|---|
| `/alloc` | No Access |
| `/alloc/data` | Full Access for *task1* and *task2* |
| `/alloc/logs` | Full Access for *task1* and *task2* |
| `/alloc/tmp` | Full Access for *task1* and *task2* |
| `/task1/local` | Full Access for *task1* |
| `/task1/private` | No Access |
| `/task1/secrets` | Read Only for *task1*, No Access for *task2*, no file listing |
| `/task1/tmp` | Full Access for *task1* |
| `/task2/local` | Full Access for *task2* |
| `/task2/private` | No Access |
| `/task2/secrets` | Read Only for *task2*, No Access for *task1*, no file listing |
| `/task2/tmp` | Full Access for *task2* |

## 🌐 Using an existing Website

By specifying a *target_website* in the task configuration you can re-use an existing website managed outside of nomad.
In this case the driver will not create a new website but instead use the existing one where it provisions the virtual applications only.

Note that there're a few restrictions when using a target_website:

- The feature [needs to be enabled](#-driver-configuration).
- Re-using an existing website managed by nomad (owned by a different job or task), is not allowed.
- Bindings and other website-related configuration will have no effect.
- You need to make sure you constrain your jobs to nodes having this target_website available, otherwise the job will fail.
- You cannot create a root-application when using a target_website.

## 💬 UDP Logging

Unfortunately, IIS doesn't attach a Console to the *w3wp* processes and therefore *STDOUT* and *STDERR* streams are not available.
As a solution, *nomad-iis* can provide a UDP-endpoint and ship those log messages to the Nomad-Client.

The UDP log-sink exposes two more environment variables:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| NOMAD_STDOUT_UDP_LOCAL_PORT | The local port the appender has to use. Only messages from this port get received and forwarded to nomad. |
| NOMAD_STDOUT_UDP_REMOTE_PORT | The remote port of the log-sink where log events must be sent to. |

Please note, that you need to configure your app's logging provider to log to this UDP endpoint.
Here is an example log4net-appender on how to log to the UDP log-sink:

```xml
<appender name="UdpAppender" type="log4net.Appender.UdpAppender">
    <localPort value="${NOMAD_STDOUT_UDP_LOCAL_PORT}" />
    <remoteAddress value="127.0.0.1" />
    <remotePort value="${NOMAD_STDOUT_UDP_REMOTE_PORT}" />
    <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout, log4net">
        <conversionPattern value="%d{dd.MM.yy HH:mm:ss.fff} %-5p [%-8t] %-35logger - %m%newline" />
    </layout>
</appender>
```

## 🛠 How to Compile

Run the setup command to download the nomad binary.

```
.\setup.ps1
```

Build the project by running the following command:

```
cd src
dotnet build
```

Of course you can also compile with Visual Studio :)

## 🐛 How to Debug locally

There is a launch-profile to run nomad in dev-mode which automatically loads the driver plugin.
Open Visual Studio, select the *Nomad* launch profile and press *F5*.

Note: To debug the driver itself, you need to attach the debugger to the nomad_iis.exe process manually.

## 🎁 How to build Release version

Run the *Release.pubxml* publish profile from Visual Studio. This will create a single binary exe called *nomad_iis.exe*.
