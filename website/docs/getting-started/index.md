# Getting Started

*Nomad IIS* is a task driver for [HashiCorp Nomad](https://nomadproject.io) to run web-applications in IIS on Windows machines. Unlike most other Nomad task drivers, this one is written in the C# language using ASP.NET 9. It uses the Microsoft.Web.Administration-API to communicate with IIS.
