|---|---|---|---|---|
| *application* | block list | yes | *none* | Defines one more applications. See *application* schema below for details. |
| target_website | string | no | *none* | Specifies an existing target website. In this case the driver will not create a new website but instead use the existing one where it provisions the virtual applications only. Please read the details [here](../features/existing-website.md). |
| managed_pipeline_mode | string | no | *IIS default* | Valid options are *Integrated* or *Classic* |
| enable_32bit_app_on_win64 | bool | no | *IIS default* | When true, enables a 32-bit application to run on a computer that runs a 64-bit version of Windows. |
| managed_runtime_version | string | no | *IIS default* | Valid options are *v4.0*, *v2.0*, *None* |
| start_mode | string | no | *IIS default* | Valid options are *OnDemand* or *AlwaysRunning* |
| idle_timeout | string | no | *IIS default* | The AppPool idle timeout in the form *HH:mm:ss* or *[00w][00d][00h][00m][00s]* |
| disable_overlapped_recycle | bool | no | *IIS default* | Defines whether two AppPools are allowed to run while recycling |
| periodic_restart | string | no | *IIS default* | The AppPool periodic restart interval in the form *HH:mm:ss* or *[00w][00d][00h][00m][00s]* |
| service_unavailable_response | string | no | *IIS default* | If this is set to `HttpLevel` and the app pool isn't running, HTTP.sys will return a 503 http-error. On the other hand if this is set to `TcpLevel` and the app pool isn't running, HTTP.sys will simply drop the connection. This may be useful when using external load balancers. |
| queue_length | number | no | *IIS default* | Indicates to HTTP.sys how many requests to queue for an application pool before rejecting future requests. |
| start_time_limit | string | no | *IIS default* | Specifies the time in the form *[00w][00d][00h][00m][00s]* that IIS waits for an application pool to start. If the application pool does not startup within the startupTimeLimit, the worker process is terminated and the rapid-fail protection count is incremented. |
| shutdown_time_limit | string | no | *IIS default* | Specifies the time in the form *[00w][00d][00h][00m][00s]* that the W3SVC service waits after it initiated a recycle. If the worker process does not shut down within the shutdownTimeLimit, it will be terminated by the W3SVC service. |

When you disable this, you may need to tweak your *web.config* a bit. Read [this](./faq.md#iusr-account) for details. |

| alias | string | no | / | Defines an optional alias at which the application should be hosted below the website. If not set, the application will be hosted at the website level. |
| enable_preload | bool | no | *IIS default* | Specifies whether the application should be pre-loaded. |
